I am a bachelor of physics student at [Sharif university of technology](sharif.edu).
I currently work on the Monte Carlo simulation of polygonal colloids in various geometries,
under the supervision of Prof. Mohammad Reza Ejtehadi.

My research interests are simulation of materials and computational soft matter physics.
More generally, I find the fields of condensed matter and computational physics appealing.
I am also interested in data science and machine learning techniques.
