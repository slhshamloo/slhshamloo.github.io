I am a bachelor of physics student at [Sharif university of technology](sharif.edu).
I currently work on the Monte Carlo simulation of polygonal colloids under the supervision
of Prof. Mohammad Reza Ejtehadi.

My research interests are computer simulations of materials, quantum technology, and
computational physics in general. I am also interested in data science and machine learning
techniques.
